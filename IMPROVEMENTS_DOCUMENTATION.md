# Real Estate CRM Improvements Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to fix the issues with leads, contacts, deals functionality, and email notifications.

### Email Configuration
Emails use the existing configuration in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "EmailSettings": {
    "SmtpServer": "smtp.gmail.com",
    "SmtpPort": 587,
    "SenderEmail": "your-email@gmail.com",
    "SenderPassword": "your-app-password",
    "SenderName": "Real Estate CRM",
    "EnableSsl": true
  }
}
```

**For Development**: If email is not configured, notifications are logged to debug console.
